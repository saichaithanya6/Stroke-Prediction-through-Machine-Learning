### Experiment Setup
This part presents an introduction to the dataset, a block diagram, a flow diagram, and evaluation criteria. Additionally, it describes the approach and methods utilized in 
the project.
The data can only be used to create a model once it has been processed. To build the model, a preprocessed dataset and machine learning techniques are required. The methods 
used in this project include Logistic Regression, Random Forest classification, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors. After creating 
eight different models, their performance is compared using metrics such as accuracy score, precision score, recall score, and F1 score.
