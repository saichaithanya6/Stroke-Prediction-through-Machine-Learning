## Stroke-Prediction-through-Machine-Learning
Problem Statement 

Stroke is a major health concern globally and has a significant impact on both individuals and healthcare systems. There are many risk factors for stroke, such as hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and lifestyle factors. 
Our project aims to use machine learning to analyze large datasets and accurately predict stroke risk based on these modifiable risk factors. The ultimate goal is to create a personalized stroke risk warning system that provides
tailored messages to individuals, suggesting lifestyle modifications to reduce their risk of stroke. This approach has the potential to transform stroke prevention and management, leading to a decrease in the impact of this life-threatening
condition on individuals and healthcare systems worldwide.

Data Description
The "healthcare-dataset-stroke-data" is a dataset available on Kaggle that contains 5110 unique patient observations with 12 attributes, including categorical and quantitative variables. The variables provide insight into 
various social, lifestyle, and medical factors that can influence stroke risk and outcomes. The dataset is a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and researchers seeking to develop more effective prevention and 
treatment strategies for stroke.
